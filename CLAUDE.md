# CLAUDE.md — operating manual for an agentic project

This file tells you, the agent, how to work in this repository. Follow it
exactly. The rules are written to be literal: when one says "do X", do X — do
not look for a cleverer path. When something is unclear or could mean two
things, stop and ask the human before you act. Clarity beats cleverness here.

## What this repository is

This repository is an **agentic project** (e.g. `agentic-acme`). It is the
externalized *thought* about a piece of software: the plans, the decisions, the
specifications, the people it serves, and the rules you work under. The software
itself — the *action* — lives beneath the project as a bare store with worktrees
(the *Where* room). You write thought in the project and action in
the worktree. Keep them separate.

You are working in a *template*. A real project replaces the example personas
with its own and adds its software as the hosted bare store with worktrees. The
structure below stays the same.

## The five rooms

The host has five rooms, one for each question you ask about any piece of work.
Put each kind of file in its room. Do not invent new top-level folders.

| Question | Room | What goes here |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Who  | `cast/` | personas — the people (human or agent) the software serves |
| What | `<software>/` (with the code) | specifications: behaviour (`.allium`), timing (`.tla`), verified in the software's own CI |
| When | `plan/` | the milestone index and one folder per milestone |
| Where | `<software>/` | the hosted software — a bare store with worktrees; you add it |
| Why  | `call/` | decisions, in MADR format (see `call/0000`) |
| How  | `CLAUDE.md` + `tools/` | this manual, and the verification tools |

`STRUCTURE.md` is the short map of the same thing. Read it once.

## How you work — four principles

These four principles govern every change. They exist because language models
make predictable mistakes; each principle blocks one.

### 1. Think before coding

- State your assumptions in plain text before you write code.
- If the request could mean more than one thing, list the meanings and ask which
  one. Do not pick one silently.
- If a simpler approach exists than the one you first reached for, say so.
- If any part of the request is unclear, stop and name the unclear thing. Ask.
  Do not guess.

The goal: the human never reads your output and says "that is not what I meant."

### 2. Keep it simple

- Write the least code that solves the stated problem. Nothing speculative.
- Do not add features that were not asked for.
- Do not add an abstraction (a base class, an interface, a wrapper) for
  something used in exactly one place. Write the concrete thing.
- Do not add configuration for a value that has exactly one setting. Hardcode it.
- Do not handle errors that cannot happen given the current inputs.
- If your code is long and the same result fits in a fraction of the lines,
  rewrite it short before you show it.

### 3. Make surgical changes

- Touch only the lines the request needs. Clean up only the mess you made.
- Do not "improve" nearby code, comments, names, or whitespace that the request
  did not ask about.
- Do not refactor working code that is not part of the request.
- Match the existing style exactly — tabs or spaces, snake_case or camelCase,
  whatever the file already uses.
- If your change leaves an import or variable unused, remove it in the same
  commit. If you spot unrelated dead code or a bug, mention it to the human; do
  not silently fix or delete it.

Check: every line you changed must trace to the request. If a line does not,
revert it.

### 4. Drive to a verifiable goal

Turn every task into a goal you can check, then loop until the check passes.

- "Add validation" becomes: write tests for the invalid inputs, then write code
  until those tests pass.
- "Fix the bug" becomes: write a test that reproduces the bug, then change code
  until that test passes.
- "Refactor X" becomes: confirm the tests pass, refactor, confirm they still pass.

For any task with more than one step, write a short numbered plan first, and give
each step a check:

```
<what you will do> -> verify by: <how you will confirm it worked>
```

If the success check is weak ("make it work"), ask the human to make it concrete
before you start.

## Names, numbers, and milestones

Numbers are identity. Slugs are content. Ordering lives in the index, never in
the name.

- A milestone is a folder in `plan/` named `NNNN-slug`: a four-digit
  zero-padded number, a hyphen, then a lowercase hyphenated slug — for example
  `0001-example-milestone`. Decisions in `call/` use the same `NNNN-slug` form.
- Name a milestone after its content, not its position. `0003-ci-pipeline` is
  good. Do **not** name things by ordinal position (`phase-one`, `M2`) or by a
  bare numeral (a header that is just "3" or "5.5"). Positions move when a plan
  is re-cut; content names stay attached to their content.
- The number is assigned when the work is accepted, and it never changes. To
  read sequence, read the index, not the filenames.
- `tools/host-lifecycle` allocates these numbers and checks the names for you.
  Use it (see below) instead of numbering by hand.

## Decisions — `call/`

When you make a choice that someone later will ask "why?", record it as a
decision in `call/`, in MADR (Markdown Any Decision Record) format. The bootstrap
decision `call/0000` explains the format and links to the MADR spec. One file per
decision, `NNNN-slug.md`, number assigned when the decision is accepted.

`call/` records decisions about **the software under development** — why your
software is built as it is. It does **not** hold methodology decisions. The
methodology is settled in this spine (`CLAUDE.md` + `STRUCTURE.md`), inherited by
copy-at-version; a change to it is made in the template and propagated by
`host-lifecycle upgrade`, never re-litigated as a project `call/`.

**Anti-ouroboros.** A project must not feed on its own methodological tail. If a
`call/` decision restates a methodology rule that is then settled or changed
upstream in the spine, retire it the MADR way: set `Status: superseded by the
spine` in place (records are immutable — you change status, never delete). The
live (`accepted`) Why room then holds only decisions still in force.
`host-lifecycle validate` fails an `accepted` decision that is missing a `Scope:`
header or declares `Scope: methodology`. The template ships `call/0000` only as a
worked example; replace it with your software's own decisions.

**Inherit from the source, not from a host.** You inherit the methodology from
*this template* (the versioned source you copy-at-version) alone. A host or
management repo's **top-level instance contents** — its `call/`, `plan/`,
`MEMORY.md`, the project-specific parts of its `CLAUDE.md` — are that project's own
rooms and bind no adopter. Do not read them as normative.

## Specs — with the software they constrain

A spec states what the software must do; a tool turns it into a check. Specs live
**with the software they describe** — in the software repo, beside the code, and
verified by **that repo's CI** — the way tests live next to code, so a spec and the
code it constrains move, version, and break together:

- Behaviour and requirements as `.allium` files — authored and maintained through
  the allium skills (`elicit`/`distill`/`tend`/`weed`/`propagate`), checked by
  `tools/allium` (`allium check` validates structure; `allium analyse` adds
  data-flow, reachability, terminal-state and deadlock analysis; `allium plan`
  derives the test obligations the suite must discharge). The software's CI runs
  `check` + `analyse` + `plan` and fails on any error or warning.
- Timing and concurrency as `.tla` files — checked by `tools/specula` (TLA+/TLC),
  run by the software's CI.

A present spec carries its full lane (see "Mandatory when used", below) — wire the
tool and its skills before authoring.

The host's `plan/<milestone>/` *references* a spec (by path and the software pin);
it does not contain it. Do not place specs in the host's `plan/` tree — quarantining
a spec from its software is a bad smell (the spec drifts from the code). A spec that
ended up under `plan/*/spec/` is relocated into the software repo.

## Personas — `cast/`

`cast/` holds the personas: short profiles of the people the software serves. A
persona is a hypothetical archetypal user, not a real individual. The examples
here (`mara.md`, a human operator, and `wren.md`, an agentic LLM) show the two
modalities; replace them with your project's own.

Build at least one persona by discussion with the human before planning the work
it serves. `cast/applying-personas.md` gives the cited process for doing this —
follow it.

## The verification ladder

Different kinds of property need different checkers — and different *strengths* of
checker. Route each claim to the lane, and to the rung, that can prove it. The base
lanes:

1. **Hygiene** — `tools/host-lint`. Catches naming tells: ordinal labels and bare
   numerals leaking into commit messages, headers, and comments. Runs as a git
   hook. **Self-referential software is excluded, not bypassed.** Software that
   *detects* tells (a linter, parser, validator, grammar tool) must embed them in
   test fixtures, docs, and sometimes source — legitimate self-reference the hook
   would otherwise flag. Exclude that corpus through the tool's ignore mechanism
   (`.host-lintignore`), which the per-file hook scan MUST honor; validate each
   excluded file line-by-line so no real tell hides among the examples, and keep
   ordinary source scanned (reword an example comment rather than mute the file).
   When a tracked *document* must instead reproduce a tell **verbatim** — an old-name
   remap table, or a frozen dated review citing another document's numbered steps —
   it is **boxed in the file, not path-excluded**: wrap it in a fenced code block
   tagged `host-lint:ignore` (markdown only), and the naming scan skips that block
   while the rest of the file stays linted — a regular code block and inline
   backticks stay scanned, so a tell cannot be laundered by quoting it. The choice is
   three-way: reword a pedagogical example or a document's own ordinal label into
   content; box an irreducible literal citation; and path-exclude only the immutable
   record (the append-only memory log, dated review artifacts) and the
   self-referential corpus above.
   **Never `--no-verify` past the gate to land a fixture** — that silently defeats
   the lane, the same "let red hide" failure as a CI matrix that fail-fast-cancels
   its own jobs. (A fix to either, once found, is a behaviour change: ship it as a
   patch release with a matching tag.) **Legitimate tell-shaped tokens are
   declared, not silenced.** A version string, product name, or cited tracker
   reference that merely *looks* like a tell is declared in a provenance-checked
   allowlist (host-lint's `LEXICON`) — each entry the full contextual phrase, masked
   before detection; a tracker reference carries its backing URL. Because a sound,
   declarable escape then exists, the identifier/reference tier MAY escalate from an
   advisory warn to a blocking flag (the committed `strict` directive), so an
   *un*declared tell-shaped token becomes a hard signal. The allowlist is provenance,
   not a mute button: the tool refuses a bare master key, a phrase that is *itself* a
   tell (rename it, do not declare it), and an un-cited tracker reference (`#N`,
   `owner/repo#N`, or an opted-in `PROJ-NNNN` key); URL liveness is re-derived by a
   network-having lane, never the offline hook.

   **Prose hygiene is the same lane, applied continuously.** Beyond naming tells,
   `host-lint --prose` audits authored docs for the LLM-slop prose tropes that
   tropes.fyi names (decoration dashes and arrows, tricolons, hypophora, and so on).
   The bar matches the naming audit: authored docs carry **zero** prose tropes, as an
   **ongoing** rule, not a one-time migration. It is wired into the **receipts
   mechanism**: the `verify` phase **applies** the prose audit and **generates** a
   receipt, and `software --check` re-verifies that receipt by re-running `host-lint
   --prose`, so a doc that regresses to slop re-opens it as a HAZARD. The one exception
   is `MEMORY.md`, the **agent's own append-only working memory**: it is excluded from
   both the naming and prose audits via `.host-lintignore`, never rewritten.
2. **Requirements** — `tools/allium` (MIT, by JUXT). Does the software meet the
   behaviour the spec states? Author and maintain `.allium` specs **through the
   allium skills**, not by hand: `elicit`/`distill` to author, `tend` to evolve,
   `weed` to find spec↔code divergence, `propagate` to generate the tests. Gate
   each spec in the software's CI with `allium check` (structure) + `allium
   analyse` (data flow, reachability, terminal states, deadlock) + `allium plan`
   (test obligations).
3. **Timing and concurrency** — `tools/specula` (Apache-2.0). TLA+ model
   checking: are the orderings and timings correct? Model-check each `.tla` with
   TLC in the software's CI.

**Deeper rungs — `tools/host-prove`** (our tooling, Unlicense). The base lanes are
*bounded*: TLC checks one finite instance, allium's tests sample inputs. When a claim
must hold for *all* parameter values or *all* inputs, host-prove drives three heavier
verifiers as agentic skills, each turning the tool's output into one machine-readable
verdict so the rung runs down to a small model:

4. **Symbolic / parametric** — **Apalache** (TLA+ → SMT/Z3; the `apalache-symbolic`
   skill). Proves a `.tla` invariant across a whole symbolic parameter family at once,
   where TLC can only enumerate one instance.
5. **Proof / unbounded** — **TLAPS** (`tlapm`; the `tlaps-proof` skill). A deductive,
   machine-checked proof that a property holds for all states — the must-hold-for-all
   claims bounded and symbolic checking cannot close. (Authoring a proof needs a strong
   model; the skill scopes a weak model to running and maintaining existing proofs.)
6. **Code-conformance** — verify the *implementation* against the spec, beyond tests
   and trace validation. This rung is **target-specific**: Rust → **Kani** (the
   `kani-conformance` skill), C → CBMC, and so on. The methodology prescribes the
   *obligation*; the project picks the verifier its language supports. (Prefer
   byte/char-level targets — `str::split`/`Vec` make CBMC-style checkers blow up.)

Read the ladder as: hygiene → requirements → bounded timing (TLC) → symbolic
(Apalache) → proof (TLAPS), with code-conformance (Kani et al.) the orthogonal rung
that ties a proven spec to the running code. The deeper rungs are **opt-in and inert**
(see below): nothing installs or runs until a project declares one.

**Mandatory when used (RFC-2119).** Adopting a lane is optional — not every
project needs TLA+ — but **once a spec of a kind exists, its tool, skills, and CI
lane are required.** A component carrying any `.allium` spec MUST wire `tools/allium`
and its skills and run `check` + `analyse` + `plan` in that repo's CI, and the
`plan` obligations MUST be discharged by the software's tests. A component carrying
any `.tla` spec MUST wire `tools/specula` and TLC-check it in that repo's CI. A spec
present without its full lane is a **defect**, not a choice — the lanes are not
reference decoration. The tools are referenced submodules; their skills are
generated, gitignored symlinks (`link-skills.sh`), wired before you author a spec.
This is **enforced**, not only stated: `host-lifecycle software --check` raises a
HAZARD when a materialized component carries a `.allium` with no `allium check` +
`allium analyse` CI workflow, or a `.tla` with no TLC lane.

The deeper rungs work the same way, one level up: they are **opt-in and inert until a
project declares a rung** by dispositioning an obligation `kani:`/`apalache:`/`tlaps:`
(below). A declaration then obliges that rung's CI lane — `software --check` HAZARDs an
obligation that declares `kani:` with no `cargo kani` lane, `apalache:` with no
`apalache-mc` lane, or `tlaps:` with no `tlapm` lane. The mere presence of a `.tla` or a
crate never activates a rung; only the declaration does, so a project pays for a heavier
verifier exactly when, and only when, it chooses to.

**Obligations are discharged, not just emitted.** `allium plan` derives a test
obligation for every config default, entity, enum, invariant, rule and transition.
Each obligation MUST be **dispositioned** in a sibling `<spec>.obligations` manifest
— the remap-dictionary discipline applied to tests — as `test:<name>` (a named test
discharges it), `structural` (the spec's own `check`/`analyse` lane covers it),
`waived: <reason>` (an honest, recorded gap), or a deeper-rung proof: `kani:<harness>`,
`apalache:<inv>`, or `tlaps:<theorem>` (a host-prove rung discharges it — stronger than
a test, for all inputs/parameters). `host-lifecycle obligations <spec> --tests <dir>
[--prove <dir>]` fails on any undispositioned obligation, any stale disposition, any
`test:<name>` absent from the test sources, and any rung proof name absent from the
`--prove` sources; the software's CI runs it, and `software --check` HAZARDs a
`.allium` that has no `.obligations` manifest. An
obligation left undispositioned is a defect — discharge is total, per component.

**A rung is discharged by re-derivation, not by name-presence (`call/0018`).** That a
proof *exists* is not that it *passes* — `--prove` only lints that the named harness,
invariant, or theorem is present (AVAILABLE ≠ DISCHARGED). The real discharge is
`host-lifecycle obligations <spec> --rederive <dir>`, which re-runs each rung's verifier
through host-prove **in its recorded pinned toolchain** and requires a PASS at the
declared `bound=` — checkable anywhere, with no keys and no dependence on a specific CI;
it generalizes the reproducible-build re-derivation (which reproduces a recorded artifact
hash) from artifacts to proofs. The cheap offline signal is **input-digest staleness**: a
rung may declare `inputs=<files>`, `--rederive --record-digests` fingerprints them with
`git hash-object` into a committed `<manifest>.digests` ledger, and a later offline run
reports the proof **STALE** if those inputs drifted without a fresh re-derivation.
Enforcement is **project-pluggable** — a required check, any CI, a pre-push hook, or the
operator running the verify phase; the methodology prescribes the re-derivation and ships
the re-deriver, and never bakes in a CI.

Two rules govern the tools:

- **Reference, don't vendor.** Each tool is a git submodule pinned to a commit.
  Do not copy its code into this repository. This governs an **adopter** consuming
  the tools. A **development host** that *authors* a host-* tool is the exception:
  it develops that tool as a Where-room software component of its own — materialized
  and released through the lifecycle like any software it builds — and consumes the
  built result (binary + worktree-sourced skills) from that worktree, rather than
  referencing its own source as a foreign submodule. Reference is for the consumer;
  the producer of a tool embeds it.
- **Instruct, don't patch.** Drive the tools through this manual and their own
  interfaces. Do not edit a tool's source to make it fit. If a tool needs a
  change, raise it upstream.

The *output* a tool produces about your project (a report, a counterexample, a
generated check) belongs to your project, not to the tool's license — the same
way a compiler's license does not cover the program it compiles.

## The host-* tools

Three of the tools are ours, released into the public domain (Unlicense):

- **host-grammar** — the shared rules for valid names and numbers. A library, not
  a command. Both tools below depend on it.
- **host-lint** — the *checker*. It reads text and flags naming tells.
- **host-lifecycle** — the *generator*. It allocates numbers and scaffolds
  milestones, decisions, and personas without spending model tokens on
  mechanical work. Run `host-lifecycle next <dir>` for the next number and
  `host-lifecycle validate <dir>` to check a folder. It also materialises and
  audits the *Where* room: `host-lifecycle software --materialize|--check <dir>`
  realises the `.host-software` bare store + worktrees and verifies each is at its
  pin.

Because the generator and the checker share `host-grammar`, what host-lifecycle
emits is exactly what host-lint accepts. Trust that symmetry; do not number by
hand.

### The lifecycle phases — every phase emits a receipt

host-lifecycle ships one Claude **skill per lifecycle phase**, generated into
`.claude/skills/` by `link-skills.sh` exactly as the allium/specula skills are:
**classify** (preview + case), **adopt** (governance + rooms + stamp), **embed**
(the software as a bare store with worktrees), **remap** (the dictionary rename),
**verify** (the gate sweep — `validate`, `software --check`, `obligations`,
`book --check`), **publish** (the doc site), **upgrade** (the ledger), and
**release** (the strict, tool-carried release — verify, build in the recorded
toolchain, re-derive the artifact hash, re-pin, tag, receipt). Each owns the
judgment around its mechanical command.

The phases — their order, modality, command, and the evidence each carries — are
not re-typed in prose; they live once in the tool-readable **`lifecycle.manifest`**
(one `[phase "<name>"]` stanza each), which `host-lifecycle` reads at the project's
adopted `.host` revision for `--next`, the `book` order, and the receipt gate. Read
the whole lifecycle at a glance with `host-lifecycle manifest <path>`.

Unlike a verification lane, which is conditional on a spec existing, the lifecycle
is **driven by the tool, never hand-operated** — and the rule is **every phase
emits a receipt**, not "every phase runs". Modality is first-class: a phase may be
**conditional** (embed and release apply only with a Where room) or **recurring**
(once per software component), so it can legitimately not run — but it still records
a **receipt** in `.host-receipts`, written by the tool: `done` with re-derivable
evidence, `skip` with a cited reason, or tool-computed `n-a`. `host-lifecycle
software --check` re-verifies each `done` by the manifest's closed `recheck =` and
**HAZARDs a phase with no receipt** — the one defect the gate needs; a protected
core (`verify`, `skippable = false`) refuses a skip outright. Operating a phase
ad-hoc (hand-scaffolding rooms, hand-renaming files, hand-rolling the site or a
release) leaves no receipt, and so is a defect by construction.

### Never adopt a software repository in place

A host is a *separate meta-repo*; the software it governs lives beneath it as the
*Where* room (a bare store with worktrees recorded in `.host-software`). The two
stay separable and independently versioned — that is the whole point of "keep
them separate". So at **first adoption** (no `.host` stamp yet), if the target
directory is itself a software repository — it carries a root build manifest
(`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, …) and is not already
managing software via `.host-software` — you **MUST** refuse to continue.
`host-lifecycle classify <dir>` enforces this: it prints the refusal and exits
non-zero instead of a case letter, rather than letting you turn the code repo
into the host.

Refusing is not the end of the task — embed the software the right way instead:
create or choose an empty host repository (e.g. `agentic-<name>`), `adopt` it
there, then add the software as the Where room with a `[software "<name>"]`
stanza in the host's `.host-software` (the repo's URL, a pinned SHA, the worktree
set) and `software --materialize`. The classify refusal prints these exact steps.

## Audited plans and append-only memory

Two disciplines keep the host trustworthy across sessions.

- **Audited plans.** Every change to `plan/` (the milestone index or any
  milestone document) and every decision in `call/` is committed and pushed
  immediately, in its own commit, not batched with code. After you finish a step
  in the software, update the plan to say what you actually did, in a separate
  commit.
- **Append-only memory.** `MEMORY.md` is a running log of decisions, discovered
  constraints, and lessons. Add a short entry whenever you finish something
  significant, hit a non-obvious bug, or find an unexpected constraint — as you
  go, not at the end. Commit it on its own and push it. Never rewrite or delete an
  old entry; if one was wrong, add a new entry that corrects it and points back.

The test for both: a new session with no memory of this conversation should be
able to read `plan/`, `call/`, and `MEMORY.md` and continue without repeating a
past mistake.

## Software and submodule discipline

The **tools** are submodules; the **software** is a bare store with worktrees.
Both follow a commit-upstream-first rule:

- **A tool submodule:** commit and push inside it (on `main`) first, then commit
  the updated submodule pointer in the host and push.
- **The software:** commit and push inside the canonical worktree first, then
  record the new SHA as the `.host-software` `pin` and push that host commit. The
  recorded pin is the audit anchor a gitlink used to be.

Never push a host commit whose tool pointer or software pin is not yet pushed. If
a push fails (no network, no auth), stop, tell the human which commits are
unpushed, and do not start work that depends on them.

**Tag every release.** A version bump — a change to the `version` in a tool's or
the software's manifest (`Cargo.toml`, …) — **MUST** be accompanied by a matching
annotated git tag `vX.Y.Z` at the release commit, pushed alongside it (`git tag -a
vX.Y.Z -m "<name> vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`). The tag **is** the release:
a tag-triggered CI job builds the artifacts from it (e.g. a `v*` release workflow).
An untagged version bump is an unreleased version — a defect; back-fill the tag at
its bump commit. Do not re-pin `.host-software` (or a tool pointer) to a
version-bumped commit that carries no matching tag.

**Worktree-absence coherence.** A separately-materialized path — the
software worktree, or a tool submodule — is absent (or empty) until materialized; a
fresh clone, CI, and a partial submodule init do not have it. So **do not git-track
an artifact that depends on such a path existing** (a skill symlink into
`<software>/` *or* into `tools/<tool>/skills/`): gitignore it and **generate** it
after materialization — `link-skills.sh` produces `.claude/skills/*` for the tools
present, and the software's links are recreated after `software --materialize`.
Where an automated context genuinely needs the path, it materializes first;
otherwise it must tolerate the absence. `host-lifecycle software --check` flags any
tracked symlink whose target is not itself tracked here as a `HAZARD`. And: an
un-materialized CI job must exercise each runtime-critical artifact — "done" means
the whole CI sweep is green, not one artifact built.

**Worktrees live under `software/`.** Every materialized Where-room worktree
**MUST** surface at `software/<name>/<branch>/` *under* the host root — never a bare
external path disjoint from the tree. The rule an agent relies on is: *if you build it, its
files live under the host root*, so an edit through the default-cwd path lands in
the tree under test. When a backing store genuinely must live elsewhere — another
filesystem or platform (e.g. a native-Windows build that cannot sit on a WSL
share) — record it on the parallel-worktree line as `store=<path>` (and optionally
`host=<os>` — the OS that **materializes** the store, i.e. where you run
`host-lifecycle`, *not* the build platform; for a Windows Dev Drive reached from WSL
that is `linux`, even though the build's own `attest-host` is `windows`). Off-platform,
`host=` makes `--materialize`/`--check` skip the line rather than fail.
`software --materialize` then realises the store at that path and the in-tree
`software/<name>/<branch>/` as a **symlink / directory junction / bind-mount** to it. `host-lifecycle software --check` **HAZARDs** any recorded worktree path that
escapes the host root, and any `store=` line whose in-tree handle is missing or
does not resolve to the store. A disjoint external worktree with no in-structure
handle is the wrong-tree footgun — edits silently land in a tree not under test —
and is a defect, not a layout choice.

**Reproducible builds — the production anchor.** Software *initiated* under the
methodology has **reproducible builds**: its deployed artifact MUST be byte-reproducible
from the pinned source plus a recorded build recipe (a pinned `toolchain` and `build`
command in `.host-software`). That is what makes the pin a true production anchor — a
clean rebuild from the pin equals what is deployed — rather than just a source pin.
Record per component which line ships (`deploy`) and the artifact's expected hash
(`artifact = <path> <sha256>`); `host-lifecycle software --check` attests these cheaply
(a present artifact that matches is **verified**; one built by a local toolchain that
differs from the canonical hash is **noted, not failed** — the same reasoning
`--install-hooks` uses, since the recorded hash is the pinned build host's output), and
a CI job runs `host-lifecycle software --verify-build` to rebuild from the pin and fail
unless the artifact reproduces. `--verify-build`, not `--check`, is the reproducibility
proof. For **greenfield** software, non-reproducibility is a defect designed out from the
start.

**Multi-platform builds.** A component whose *one* source pin ships on several platforms
records one `[build "<name>" "<platform>"]` subsection per platform under its
`[software "<name>"]` stanza, each carrying its own `build`/`toolchain`/`artifact`/`deploy`
(and optional `repro-exempt`) plus an `attest-host` naming the OS — `linux`, `windows`,
`macos` — that reproduces it. `--check` and `--verify-build` iterate the builds and attest
each only on its `attest-host`, skipping a build whose host is not the current one rather
than failing (a Linux runner cannot reproduce the Windows artifact, and is not asked to).
The flat single-build fields remain the form for a single-platform component.

**Escape clause (migrated software only).** Pre-existing software brought under the
methodology may not be reproducible yet. It may carry `repro-exempt = call/NNNN` citing a
recorded **case decision** — a software-scoped `call/` decision documenting why it is not
yet reproducible and the interim provenance. `--verify-build` then warns and skips the
rebuild comparison; `--check` still requires the citation to resolve. The exemption is
meant to be retired as the component converges on reproducibility, and is **never**
available to greenfield software.

## Upgrading

Adopting is one event; the template moves on. The `.host` stamp records **what you
have applied**: a `baseline` ledger entry — every entry at or before its position in
`UPGRADING.md` counts as applied — plus an optional `applied` set of entries taken
out of order. `UPGRADING.md` is the ledger of actions, one `[upgrade "<revision>"]`
stanza each, ordered by file position; a stanza may declare `independent` or
`depends = <id> …` (logical prerequisites, distinct from the `requires` tool-version
floor) and a `verify` post-condition.

To upgrade, fetch the template to the target revision, then:

- `host-lifecycle upgrade <dir>` lists every ledger entry **not yet applied**, by
  ledger position — never git ancestry (ledger SHAs are a linear-commit artifact and
  some are orphaned from HEAD). A legacy single-`revision` stamp is migrated once to a
  `baseline`. `upgrade --next` prints the single next safe action.
- Apply an entry, then record it with `host-lifecycle upgrade --record <id>` (an id,
  an unambiguous prefix, or a ledger ordinal). The tool validates the id, refuses if a
  `depends` is unapplied, runs the entry's `verify` post-condition — or, when it has
  none, requires an explicit `--unverified call/NNNN` citation — and appends an
  append-only claim. **You never hand-edit the stamp.**
- A late **independent** entry may be cherry-applied without an earlier unrelated one:
  the deferred entries stay pending and **re-list** — a forgotten or premature record
  can never silently hide owed work (fail-safe). `upgrade --advance` later compacts a
  contiguous applied run into the `baseline`.
- `host-lifecycle software --check` re-checks every recorded claim (a `verify` that no
  longer holds, or an applied entry whose `depends` is unapplied, is a loud `HAZARD`).

The tool carries the process — even a low-capability agent upgrades by reading one
line and running one command, never editing the stamp by hand. Re-stamp is the tool's
job, not yours.

## Provenance

The four working principles are rewritten, in our own words, from observations by
Andrej Karpathy on where LLM coding goes wrong, by way of Jiayuan Zhang
(@forrestchang) and the andrej-karpathy-skills contributors. The persona process
in `cast/applying-personas.md` follows Powell, Keenan and McDaid (2007) on
personas in XP, with later agile work cited alongside it. This manual is released
